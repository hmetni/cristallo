This is a simple crystallography calculator aiming to facilitate computations necessary for predicting/exploiting
X-ray diffraction.

The first (and main) part allows the user to :

  1 - Calculate interreticular distances of (hkl) planes in a general crystal systems, given different lengths and angles
  
  2 - Calculate the same interreticular distances for specific crystal systems (cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic and hexagonal)
  
  3 - Predict at which angles different (hkl) planes will show up 
  
  4 - See which family planes will show first depending on the crystal system

The second part (the last cell) allows the user to estimate the intensity factor of the different peaks.

This intensity factor is the product of the plane family multiplicity and the so-called Lorentz and polarization factors.
